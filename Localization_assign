# The function localize takes the following arguments:
#
# colors:
#        2D list, each entry either 'R' (for red cell) or 'G' (for green cell)
#
# measurements:
#        list of measurements taken by the robot, each entry either 'R' or 'G'
#
# motions:
#        list of actions taken by the robot, each entry of the form [dy,dx],
#        where dx refers to the change in the x-direction (positive meaning
#        movement to the right) and dy refers to the change in the y-direction
#        (positive meaning movement downward)
#        NOTE: the *first* coordinate is change in y; the *second* coordinate is
#              change in x
#
# sensor_right:
#        float between 0 and 1, giving the probability that any given
#        measurement is correct; the probability that the measurement is
#        incorrect is 1-sensor_right
#
# p_move:
#        float between 0 and 1, giving the probability that any given movement
#        command takes place; the probability that the movement command fails
#        (and the robot remains still) is 1-p_move; the robot will NOT overshoot
#        its destination in this exercise
#
# The function should RETURN (not just show or print) a 2D list (of the same
# dimensions as colors) that gives the probabilities that the robot occupies
# each cell in the world.
#
# Compute the probabilities by assuming the robot initially has a uniform
# probability of being in any cell.
#
# Also assume that at each step, the robot:
# 1) first makes a movement,
# 2) then takes a measurement.

#  [0,-1] - left

#  [-1,0] - up
